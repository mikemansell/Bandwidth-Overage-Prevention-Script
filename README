The purpose of this script is to monitor bandwidth on a server and take a specific action
whenever said server goes over a pre-defined monthly bandwidth cap.  The original reason 
that I wrote this script was so that I could safely utilize a service such as Rackspace
CloudServers for a personal Irssi session without having to worry about incurring huge
bandwidth fees if someone were to attempt denial of service on my server.  In my example,
I use the command "iptables-restore < /etc/firewall-lockdown.conf" to apply a locked-down
IPTables ruleset that blocks ALL traffic if I go over my self-set cap, however you may
opt to simply use the "shutdown" command to power down the server.

The script requires "screen" to run in daemon mode and "vnstat" to monitor network traffic.
